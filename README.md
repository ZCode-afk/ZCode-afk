- Hi, I’m @ZCode-afk:
-   I’m interested in Cyber Security and pc building/repair
-   I'm currently learning how to take apart and rebuild pc's and also trying to learn javascript
-   Later on i will be trying to learn networking(need to know this for Cyber Security)
-   and how to repair broken pc's(For now i'm trying to get comfortable with taking apart and rebuilding pc's before i tackle repairing them )
